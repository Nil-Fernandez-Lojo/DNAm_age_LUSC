# DNAm_age_LUSC
This repository contains a study of the DNA methylation age in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) tumour cells. 

The report is given in the report folder.

The R scripts generating all the presented results and figures from the report are given in the code folder. To run them, set the working directory to the code folder. The folder also contains the sessioninfo.txt file which lists all the packages and their versions used to generate the results.

The data folder contains the following datasets:
- Clinical : it contains clinical information from the patients and was downloaded from the Clinical_pick_Tier1 folder in TCGA LUSC data.
- cnv :  it contains cnv information and was downloaded from the genome_wide_snp_6_segmented_scna_minus_germline_cnv_hg19 folder in TCGA LUSC data.
- LUSC-1.Rda: It contains the DNAm methylation age of some patients. This file was generated by Vincent Detours.
- rnaseq_unnormalised : The file was too large and could not be uploaded on Github. It needs to be downloaded from TCGA LUSC data from the folder illuminahiseq_rnaseqv2_RSEM_genes.
- somatic_mutations : It contains a list of somatic mutations in different samples and was downloaded from the Mutation_Packager_Calls folder in TCGA LUSC data.
